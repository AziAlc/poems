Hello this is a haiku
How are you doing. OMG WHY WORK?
Okay but not really okay


..create a branch and push-u
git checkout -b name
git push --set-upstream origin name

..do this to get list of remote branches (name)
git remote update --origin prune.

..to track a branch
git checkout --track origin/nameofbranch


..delete remote branch
git push origin --delete brachname
